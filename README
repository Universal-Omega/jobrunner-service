NAME
redisJobRunnerService -- Continuously process a MediaWiki jobqueue

DESCRIPTION
redisJobRunnerService is an infinite "while loop" used to call MediaWiki runJobs.php
and eventually attempt to process any job enqueued. A number of virtual sub-loops with
their own runners and job types must be defined via parameters. These loops can set any
of the job types as either low or high priorty. High priority will get ~80% of the time
share of the sub-loop under "busy" conditions. If there are few high priority jobs, the
loops will spend much more of their time on the low priority ones.

This script is normally ran from the $IP directory of MediaWiki.
The --wrapper parameter is used to run some wrapper with a given command
by passing runJobs.php and the rest of the parameters as arguments to it.
For example, the value "php MWScript.php" could be used.

You will probably want to run this script under your webserver username.

Example:
// Process jobs of type "webVideoTranscode" with a maxtime of 4 hours with 5 runners
redisJobRunnerService --aggrSrvs <h:p> --queueSrvs <h:p> --timeout 14400 --runners 5:webVideoTranscode

// Process jobs of type "AssembleUploadChunks"/"PublishedStashedFile" with 2 runners
redisJobRunnerService --aggrSrvs <h:p> --queueSrvs <h:p> --runners "5:AssembleUploadChunks,PublishedStashedFile'

// Process jobs of type "A"/"B" with 2 runners and "C"/"D" with 2 runners
redisJobRunnerService --aggrSrvs <h:p> --queueSrvs <h:p> --runners "5:A,B|3:C,D"

// Process jobs of all runners except refreshLinks/null and deprioritize renameUser
redisJobRunnerService --aggrSrvs <h:p> --queueSrvs <h:p> --runners "5:*,-refreshLinks,-null,~renameUser"
